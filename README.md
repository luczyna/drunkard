# [Drunkard Test](http://tropvache.com/util/drunkard "test yo'self with the drunkard test")

## Test out how drunk you are.

With all the speed and accuracy you can muster, click or tap the blips that appear on screen. This may or may not be very difficult, depending on how inebriated you are. For a crazy time, try psychadelic mode!

## About the test

The **Drunkard Test** is an Angular.js app built using HTML5 canvas for the game aspect of the test. Heavily inspired by co-workers, made with the intention to revel in how hard it is to not be drunk, meant for the light-hearted times. Better safe than sorry.

## Features
